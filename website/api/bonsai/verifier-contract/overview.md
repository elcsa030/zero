# Verifier Contract

The verifier contract, deployed on Ethereum, is responsible for verifying proofs
generated by the ZKVM. It ensures the validity of proofs submitted by a prover,
such as Bonsai or any other entity.

After a proof request is submitted by a smart contract, the subsequent proof is generated by an off-chain worker. The resulting proof is then submitted on-chain again for validation. However, it is important to note that the outputs of the proof can only be trusted and used after ensuring that the proof is valid. The verifier contract plays a crucial role in this process by checking the validity of the proof. If the proof is deemed valid, the verifier contract returns a boolean response indicating its validity. This step ensures that the results obtained from the proof can be trusted and utilized by the smart contract, providing a secure and reliable flow for proving within the system.

This streamlined process simplifies verification for users, making it more
efficient and cost-effective. By using a single verifier contract, multiple
programs can be verified, eliminating the need for separate contracts for
specific circuits. The verifier contract offers flexibility, composability, and
compatibility with various application-specific Groth16 circuits, making it an
ideal choice for verifying a wide range of applications and circuits within the
zkVM ecosystem.
