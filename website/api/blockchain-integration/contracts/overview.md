# Verifier Contract

To utilize the results generated by a [zkVM program][term-zkvm-program] in the Blockchain, it’s essential to confirm their correctness and integrity. This [verification][term-verify] is accomplished through a verifier contract. Specifically, RISC Zero’s verifier contract performs the task of validating [Groth16 SNARK][article-groth16] proofs, which are produced by the [Bonsai proving service][Bonsai].

The verifier contract incorporates the [`IRiscZeroVerifier` interface][IRiscZeroVerifier.sol], which defines the necessary data structures for the receipt and includes a `verify` method. This interface is implemented by the [`RiscZeroGroth16Verifier` contract][RiscZeroGroth16Verifier.sol], a stateless and immutable verifier designed for RISC Zero Groth16 SNARK proofs.

Given the nature of the zkVM, any computation performed off-chain can be proven on-chain using a single verifier contract. This simplifies system architecture and eliminates the need for multiple contracts for different circuits. Even in the case of a system that needs to use custom circuits, it's possible to prove the resulting custom [receipts][term-receipt] within a [zkVM program][term-zkvm-program] and submit the resulting proof to the verifier contract.

## Using the Verifier Contract

In the [Foundry Template][foundry-template], you can find a complete example of how to use the verifier contract in your application.
Specifically, the [EvenNumber.sol] contract demonstrates how to use the [IRiscZeroVerifier.sol] interface to verify a proof.

## Versioning

Currently, the verifier contract is designed to support a static version, and we
may change the contract's address when we release a new version. It's important
to keep track of the latest version and update your application accordingly.

## Addresses

RISC Zero provides an already deployed verifier contract in the Sepolia network for your convenience. You can choose to use this contract or deploy your own.
