//! A virtual machine that produces zero-knowledge proofs of computation.
//!
//! The RISC Zero zkVM is a RISC-V virtual machine that produces
//! [zero-knowledge proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof)
//! of code it executes. When programs are executed in the RISC Zero
//! zkVM, a cryptographic [Receipt](host::Receipt) is generated. Anyone with the
//! receipt can verify that it was produced via execution of the zkVM's guest
//! code. No additional information about code execution (such as which inputs
//! were provided to the guest) is revealed by publishing the
//! [Receipt](host::Receipt). A high-level overview of how the zkVM is
//! structured to accomplish this is available in our [Overview of the zkVM](https://www.risczero.com/docs/explainers/zkvm/zkvm_overview).
//!
//! Developers new to RISC Zero are encouraged to begin with our
//! [Risc Zero Rust Starter repository](https://github.com/risc0/risc0-rust-starter),
//! a minimal example program that demonstrates through zero-knowledge proof
//! that a number is composite. The example also introduces key components of
//! the RISC Zero zkVM.
