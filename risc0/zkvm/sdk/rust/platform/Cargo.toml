# This crate is a potential dependency of the rust standard library.
# As such, it should not depend on anything the rust standard library
# doesn't.
#
# Also, it needs special trickery to work with the rust standard
# library build scripts; see rustc-std-workspace-core/README.md in the
# rust tree for details.
