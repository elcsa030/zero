//! A virtual machine to produce ZK proofs of computation
//!
//! The RISC Zero zkVM is a RISC-V virtual machine that produces
//! [zero-knowledge proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof)
//! of code it executes. By using the zkVM, a cryptographic
//! [Receipt](Receipt) is produced which anyone can [verify](Receipt::verify)
//! was produced by the zkVM's guest code. No additional information about the
//! code execution (such as, for example, the inputs provided) is revealed by
//! publishing the [Receipt](Receipt).
//!
//! This is the reference documentation for the RISC Zero zkVM. We have
//! additional (non-reference) resources for using our zkVM that you may also
//! find helpful, especially if you're new to the RISC Zero zkVM. These include:
//!
//! * Our [Hello Multiply!](https://www.risczero.com/docs/examples/hello_multiply)
//! tutorial, which walks you through writing your first zkVM project.
//! * A [zkVM Rust starter template](https://github.com/risc0/risc0-rust-starter),
//! a template for starting zkVM projects. It includes code for building and
//! launching a zkVM guest and guidance on where projects most commonly modify
//! host and guest code.
//! * The [zkVM Rust examples repository](https://github.com/risc0/risc0-rust-examples),
//! which contains various examples using our zkVM.
//! * [This clip](https://youtu.be/cLqFvhmXiD0) from our presentation at ZK Hack
//! III gives an overview of the RISC Zero zkVM.
//! [Our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@risczero) has many more
//! videos as well.
//! * And more on [the RISC Zero website](https://www.risczero.com/)!
