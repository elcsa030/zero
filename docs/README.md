RISC Zero offers a `developer-focused, open-source ZKVM`, and we're excited to see developers join us as we step into the era of `zero-knowledge application design.` 

- The [risc0 README](https://github.com/risc0/risc0#readme) includes instructions for installing the RISC Zero ZKVM on your machine. 
- The [Battleship README](https://github.com/risc0/risc0/tree/main/examples/rust/battleship#readme) includes instructions for installing RISC Zero Battleship, which operates on the NEAR Network. 
- This [`docs`](https://github.com/risc0/risc0/tree/main/docs) folder is an open-source documentation repository to accompany the official documentation we offer at [www.risczero.com](www.riscero.com) and throughout the `risc0` repo.
