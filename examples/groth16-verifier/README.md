# Groth16 verifier Example

This example shows how to verify inside the zkVM a Groth16 snark proof over the BN_254 curve,
generated by Circom/SnarkJS.

## Summury
This example uses a pre-generated Groth16 proof of a Sudoku solution generated via [zkSudoku].
Specifically, you will learn:
- How to verify a `Groth16 proof` generated by Circom/SnarkJS. To know more how to generate such a proof follow the [zkSudoku] README or the Circomm [tutorial]. You can also try with an [ECDSA-circuit] example created by [0xPARC].
- How to prove the verification of a `Groth16 proof` from the zkVM.
